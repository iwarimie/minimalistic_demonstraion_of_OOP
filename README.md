To run this code, you would need to have node installed on your local machine.
Once you have cloned the repository into your local directory, cd into the the folder that has your code open you terminal and run "[node animal_oop2.js]"
The results would be shown on your console.
Although, I feel this code can be made to be DRY(Don't REpeat Yourself) by applying the 3rd SOLID Principle, Composition against the use of Inheritance, Destructuing, and Pure functions.
